# Manual - Ravens

Welcome to the **Ravens** manual.  
With this app, you can easily view observations from [waarneming.nl](https://waarneming.nl).

When you open Ravens, you’ll see a screen with observations, divided across several tabs. The tabs are: **We (Me)**, **Radius**, **Location**, **Species**, and **Settings**.  
This manual explains each part of the app step by step so you can easily get started.
